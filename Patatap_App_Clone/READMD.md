# Patatap Clone
Patatap is a visual sound kit application with animations by computer programmer Jono Brandel and Japanese electronic duo Lullatone, consisting of Shawn James Seymour and Yoshimi Tomida.
So me along with my instructor Colt Steele, made this simple, nice and interactive project. It's actually a very small portion of the original Patatap app. This app generate random circles of varying radii and colors, when a user hit any key from  A-B in the keyboard it produces sound associated with that key along with little impressive animation.
